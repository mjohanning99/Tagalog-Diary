# Tagalog Diary — 2022-04-30
Magandang umaga! I did, unfortunately, not really have a lot of time to study Tagalog, mostly due to the fact that I had to work again _and_ also study for my final exam which is in just a couple of days. And going through some old exams, I found out that our school failed to teach us _a lot of things_; and therefore, I am trying to learn these things on my own now. 

Nevertheless, as it is now Saturday and I do have more time on my hand — as I do not have to work —, I will try to study both a little bit of Tagalog and study for my exam as well. Tara na!

## Tasks
- [x] Watch the second video about numbers
- [x] Finish lesson 22 (20-21 were the video lessons on numbers)
- [x] Learn some more vocabulary
- [x] Speak / write a bit
- [x] Take the sixth assessment test

## Interesting new words or expressions
- __<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">um</mark><mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">ulan</mark>__
	- a verb which means “to rain”
	- a normal -um- verb
		- But as the root starts with a vowel, the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">-um-</mark> infix turns into an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">um-</mark> prefix. 
- __palagi__
	- “always”
- __minsan__
	- “sometimes”
- __kwarto__ 
	- “room”
	- This word was not actually part of the lesson itself, but it was in the lesson notes and I thought it was good to know

## What was most difficult?
The most difficult part was most definitely learning all the numbers; and whilst I have definitely gotten better at them, I still don’t really know them well whatsoever.

## What was learnt or done?
As mentioned in the introduction, I spent most of my studying time today on learning for my final exam. However, as it is Saturday — and I have some times on my hand —, I also had time to study a bit of Tagalog. 

### Number time — once more!
First, let us talk about the video lesson: it taught the numbers from 20 through 999 and they were all rather straightforward. They are formed in a manner similar to how the numbers 10 - 19 are formed, namely by taking the base number, adding a connector word, adding <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">-pu</mark> and then adding _at_ (“and”) and another number; the connecting particle is either <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">-ng</mark> or <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">na</mark>, depending on whether the number ends on a vowel or consonant; however there are two things to know: firstly, if the letter “p” follows the connector, then it turns into <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">-m-</mark>; and if the vowel preceding the connector <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">-ng </mark> is an “o”, then this vowel is changed to “u”. Here is a table with the numbers 20 through 100: — 

| English | Tagalog                                                                                                                                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| twenty  | <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">dalawa</mark><mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">m</mark><mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">pu</mark>       |
| thirty  | <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">tatl<b>u</b></mark><mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">m</mark><mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">pu</mark> |
| forty   | <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">apat</mark><mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">na</mark><mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">pu</mark>        |
| fifty   | <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">lima</mark><mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">m</mark><mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">pu</mark>         |
| sixty   | <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">anim</mark><mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">na</mark><mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">pu</mark>        |
| seventy | <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">pitl<b>u</b></mark><mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">m</mark><mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">pu</mark>        |
| eighty  | <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">wal<b>u</b></mark><mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">m</mark><mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">pu</mark>         |
| ninety  | <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">siyam</mark><mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">na</mark><mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">pu</mark>       |
| hundred | <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">daan</mark>                                                                                                    |

Note that the numbers _tatlo_ (three), _pitlo_ (seven) and _walo_ (eight) all change their final vowel to _-u_. 

Saying things such as “twenty-two” or “thirty-eight” can be done, as previously discussed, by adding _at_ and the base number. However, _at_ is shortened to simply _’t_ after vowels. Therefore, twenty-two turns into _dalawampu’t dalawa_ and thirty-eight into _tutlumpu’t walo_. 

### Time for some adjectives
The other lesson I went through today taught the usage of adjectives. I have already learnt about those, so the lesson did not really contain a lot of new information for me. I will, however, shortly recap the two manners in which adjectives can be used: —

- “The coffee is hot” ↪ “Mainit ang kape”
- “Hot coffee” ↪ “Mainit na kape”

Thus, if you want to simply state that the coffee is hot, the formula _adjective_ + “ang” + _noun_ is used; for applying the adjective directly to a noun (“warm day”, “hot coffee” etc.), the pattern _adjective_ + “na” + _noun_ is used. Once more, it is important to note that <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">na</mark> turns into <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">-ng</mark> after a vowel.
