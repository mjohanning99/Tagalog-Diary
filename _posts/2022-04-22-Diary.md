# Tagalog Diary — 2022-04-22
I am currently in Bavaria, but that will not keep me from studying Tagalog! However, as was doing a lot of things today, this diary entry will be much shorter than the previous one.

## Tasks
- [x] Finish at least lesson 13
- [x] Study more vocab
- [x] Speak / write a bit

## Interesting new words
This lesson was, unfortunately, rather sparse on new words. The most interesting one would have go be _gáling (sa)_ which means “from”. An example sentence would be: “Gusto kong bumilin pagkain galing sa Burger King”.

## What was most difficult?
There were no really difficult bits in lesson 13. The dialogue was very short and contained only short and simple sentences.

## What was learnt?
This lesson’s focus was on giving and receiving gifts. The main (and informal) way of doing so is by simply saying the following: _Heto, pasalubong galing sa Pilipinas para sa’yo_, “Look / here, a souvenir from the Philippines for you.” This can be replied to with _Nag-abala ka pa!_, which the course notes translate as ”You shouldn’t have!“. Mag-abala appears to be a regular actor-focussed verb of the _mag-_ variety which means ”to bother / worry about / trouble (oneself).“ Its root, _abalá_ means ”busy, occupied, preoccupied, focussed on“.
