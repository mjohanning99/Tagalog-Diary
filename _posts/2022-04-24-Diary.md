## Interesting new words
- __mukháng__
	- an adjective that translates to “it seems” or “it looks”
	- _Mukhang uulan ngayon_ (“It seems that it will rain today”)
	- _Mukhang masarap ito_ (“It looks delicious”)
- __kainan na__
	- not really a word but rather an expression or interjection
	- it means “let’s eat!”

## What was most difficult?
The notes for lesson 15 include some information regarding _ang_, but describe it as “an article which functions similarly to ‘the.’ This article marks that the word or words next to it or after it are the subject of the sentence, which can be a noun or an adjective”. I find this somewhat confusing, as _ang_ is not always equivalent to the English definite article. 
Additionally, the notes also state that when _mo_ follows “a verb, it functions as the pronoun ‘you’”; this is correct, but not all verbs take _mo_. For example, the sentence _Iinom ka ba ng tsaa?_ means “Will you drink tea?” and it uses _ka_ instead of _mo_. This appears to be a difference between the so-called _ang_ version of the pronoun and the _ng_ version. 

Lesson 16 was more straightforward and there wasn’t really anything that was difficult there.

## What was learnt?
The main theme of lesson fifteen was asking whether something belongs to someone. The structure for that kind of question is rather simple and goes as follows: “noun mo ba ito?” (“Is this your noun?”), wherein _mo_ and _ito_ can be replaced with a different (demonstrative) pronoun (_Bahay ko ba iyan?_, “Is that my house?”).
As mentioned above, however, it also states that _mo_ functions as the pronoun “you” when followed by a verb; but as I know, not every verb takes _mo_, as some actually take _ko_.
This lead me to want to research more about the differences between these two sets of pronouns and as it turns out, the verb determines what set of pronouns is used; <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">actor-focus</mark> verbs require the actor to be in the _ng_ form (“ako“, “ka”) and the object in the _ang_ form (“ko”, “mo”) whereas <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">object-focus</mark> verbs are the other way around. I am hoping that this will be explained more thoroughly in the upcoming lessons.

Lesson sixteen’s main theme was the teaching of how to ask what something is, “Ano ba ito?” (“What is this?”). Additionally, a new word — _mukhang_ — was taught, that can be used to say things such as “it seems delicious”.

I also took the Level 1 Practice Test 5 and scored 100%.
